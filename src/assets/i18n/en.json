More volatile investments generally offer greater long-term growth potential than less volatile investments, but they may produce greater losses. How much volatility are you comfortable with?",
        "question3": "Extremely conservative investments sometimes earn less than the inflation rate. This may result in the loss of purchasing power. With respect to your investment objectives, which of the following is most true?",
        "question4": "You understand the value of investments will fluctuate over time, depending on the amount of risk taken. What is the approximate loss in any one-year period that you would be willing to accept before deciding to change your investments?",
        "question5": "Consider two different investments: Investment A, which provides an average annual return of 5% with a minimal risk of loss of value, and Investment B, which provides an average annual return of 10% and a potential loss of 25% or more in any year. How would you divide your investment dollars?",
        "question6": "If you could choose only one of the five hypothetical portfolios characterized below, which would you select?",
